Collaborative healthcare is shaped by complex negotiations among patients, caregivers, and clinicians, yet current technologies focus
primarily on monitoring and adherence, offering limited support for shared decision-making. Differences in knowledge, power, and
goals often generate tension around treatment, lifestyle, and data-sharing decisions. Recent advances in GenAI and LLMs open the
possibility for AI to act as a mediator, translating clinical evidence into patient-relevant insights, visualizing trade-offs, and supporting
negotiation without overriding human agency. This workshop aims to bring together an interdisciplinary mix of HCI researchers, AI
practitioners, clinicians, and designers to explore AI-mediated collaboration. Through hands-on activities, participants will discuss
design challenges and opportunities, identify ethical and socio-technical tensions, create speculative design stories, and future research
avenues. The goal is to develop a shared research agenda for interactive health systems that foster equitable negotiation, respect
stakeholder agency, and place human relationships at the center of collaborative care.

1 Introduction
Collaboration plays a central role in healthcare management, particularly in contexts of chronic illness and long-term
care [11]. However, this collaboration unfolds among stakeholders with differing goals, levels of expertise, and degrees
of power, including patients, informal caregivers, and healthcare professionals [11]. These asymmetries create persistent
challenges for information sharing, day-to-day support, and the definition and negotiation of personalized care plans,
often leading to misalignment between clinical recommendations and the expectations, lived experiences and values of
patients [13].
Digital health technologies and the data they generate have the potential to support collaborative care by enabling
communication, coordination, and shared sensemaking among stakeholders [1, 5, 7, 10, 17]. However most existing
systems remain primarily oriented toward monitoring, motivation / adherence, and reporting, offering limited support
for the joint exploration and interpretation of data or for negotiating diverging interests and priorities [2, 16]. As a
result, there is a critical gap in interactive mechanisms that facilitate shared understanding while respecting the distinct
perspectives, needs, and agency of each stakeholder involved in care.
Recent advances in GenAI and LLMs introduce new opportunities to address this gap showing potential to support
data exploration, generate adaptive explanations, and tailored representations to different audiences [18]. Prior research
has explored the use of AI in healthcare as a diagnostic aid [ 3, 6, 9], a clinical monitoring tool [ 4, 12, 15], and for
everyday support [8, 14]. However, the role of AI in collaborative healthcare remains underexplored, particularly its
potential to function not only as an individual support tool, but also as a mediator that facilitates communication,
negotiation, and shared decision-making among multiple stakeholders.
This workshop aims to critically examine the current and future role of AI in supporting collaboration in healthcare.
We focus specifically on how AI-based systems might be designed to responsibly support moments of negotiation, such
as decisions about what data to collect, how to interpret it, and how to share it across stakeholders, while preserving
individual agency, ascertaining the required accountability, promoting transparency, and addressing power imbalances.
Through the use of real-world case studies, illustrative scenarios, and participatory design activities, the workshop
will provide a space to surface challenges, identify barriers and design requirements, and explore opportunities for
integrating AI into real-world collaborative health monitoring contexts. Ultimately, the workshop seeks to contribute to
the future of collaborative health monitoring by building a shared understanding of AI’s role in mediating collaboration,
negotiation, and shared decision-making, fostering a cross-disciplinary community . and shared decision-making, and
fostering a cross-disciplinary community.
2 Workshop Goals
The primary goal of this workshop is to bridge cross-disciplinary perspectives between researchers and practitioners
interested in how AI technologies can be designed, developed, and deployed to support collaborative health monitoring
and care. The workshop aims to move beyond individual-focused AI applications toward a shared understanding of the
role of AI in mediating collaboration, negotiation, and shared decision-making among multiple healthcare stakeholders.
In doing so, it seeks to foreground patient agency and empowerment while critically examining power dynamics,
ethical considerations, and socio-technical challenges that shape AI-supported collaboration in real-world care contexts.
To guide this discussion, the workshop will focus on three overarching goals: (1) Identify challenges, tensions and
opportunities in AI-supported negotiation and shared decision-making; (2) Build a cross-disciplinary community around
AI-mediated collaboration and negotiation in healthcare; (3) Articulate open research questions and future directions for

interactive health systems; To address these goals, the workshop seeks to bring together researchers and practitioners
from HCI, interactive health, AI/ML, clinical practice, ethics, and design. Participants will be encouraged to share
real-world experiences, case studies, and challenges related to collaboration in healthcare, including both successful
and problematic uses of AI technologies. Through structured discussions and participatory activities, the workshop
will foster dialogue around existing designs, emerging practices, and future directions. Ultimately, the workshop aims
to build a shared understanding and a cross-disciplinary community around AI-mediated collaboration in healthcare,
laying the groundwork for future research collaborations and impactful interactive health systems. The workshop
invites contributions that engage with the following topics: (1) Design and evaluation of interactive health technologies
for patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals; (2) Collaboration, negotiation, and shared decision-making in care;
(3) AI technologies, ethics and governance in healthcare; (4) Privacy, consent, and data-sharing in multi-stakeholder
health ecosystems; (5) Participatory, co-design, and user-centered design methods in healthcare research; (6) Use of AI
in clinical workflows and real-world constraints in the deployment of AI systems in care settings.
3 Workshop Structure and Activities
The workshop will take place in person over one day, complemented by pre-workshop asynchronous activities to foster
early engagement and broaden participation.
Approximately two weeks prior to the workshop, participants will be invited to join an asynchronous communication
space (e.g., a Slack server). This space aims to support inclusive participation, including engagement from individuals
who may not be able to attend the workshop in person, and to create a more informal environment for participants
to get to know each other. Dedicated channels will be created for introductions, workshop-related discussions, topic
exploration, and discussion of accepted submissions. Participants will also be encouraged to collaboratively identify
and discuss scenarios illustrating the role of AI in collaborative healthcare. Shared collaborative tools (e.g., Miro boards)
will be used to collect and structure these scenarios ahead of the workshop.
During the in-person workshop, three lightning talks will provide initial perspectives and seed discussion, while
the majority of the time will be dedicated to small-group discussions and hands-on collaborative activities. Building
on the scenarios identified during the pre-workshop phase, groups will engage in speculative design activities to
explore challenges, tensions, and opportunities related to AI-mediated collaboration and negotiation in healthcare. Each
group will iteratively develop speculative design stories that surface barriers and propose possible design strategies for
overcoming them, using shared Miro boards to support collaborative ideation.
After each activity, groups will report back to the full workshop, enabling cross-group reflection and synthesis. To
ensure continued inclusion of participants who are not physically present, the Miro boards and discussion summaries
will be shared in the asynchronous communication space, allowing for further commentary and reflection beyond
the workshop day. These shared artifacts will serve as both documentation and key workshop outputs. These are the
planned activities:
Introduction and welcome (10 minutes):The workshop will begin with a brief welcome from the organizers to
introduce the objectives, schedule, and expected outcomes. Participants will receive an overview of the day’s activities
and be allocated to working groups, which will remain the same during activities.
Ice-breaking activity and participant introductions (30 minutes):Participants will introduce themselves,
sharing their background, expertise, and interests in AI, healthcare, or collaborative technologies. The goal is to create
a welcoming atmosphere, enable participants to identify shared interests, and facilitate networking early in the day.

Lightning talks: perspectives from HCI, AI, and health practice (40 minutes):Three short talks will be
presented, each focusing on a different perspective: HCI and interactive design in healthcare; AI/ML capabilities and
limitations in health applications; Clinical practice and real-world constraints. After the talks we will have QA, allowing
participants to clarify concepts, ask questions, and connect the perspectives across disciplines. This session sets a
common foundation for later group discussions and activities.
Break (15 minutes):A coffee break for participants to refresh and network.
Tools and scenarios for collaboration (60 minutes):Participants will explore tools, processes, and scenarios
for collaborative healthcare. The focus is on how patients, caregivers, and clinicians negotiate, share information, and
coordinate activities. Groups will identify challenges, trade-offs, and opportunities for improving collaboration, without
focusing specifically on AI. Each group will then report back their findings to the full workshop, highlighting insights,
tensions, and questions that emerge from real-world collaborative scenarios.
Current opportunities and challenges of AI in collaborative health (60 minutes):Participants will discuss
existing AI applications, limitations, ethical concerns, and power dynamics, and reflect on how AI currently supports
or hinders collaboration. In small groups, they will analyze case studies that reflect diverse healthcare contexts (e.g.
formal vs informal settings, synchronous and asynchronous settings) and examples of AI deployments and report back
key insights, including gaps and challenges that could inform future AI-mediated interventions. Each group will then
report back to the full workshop, sharing key insights, identified gaps, and recurring challenges. As an outcome, groups
will articulate a set of research provocations or design hypotheses to guide future work on AI-mediated collaboration
in healthcare.
Lunch (90 minutes):Lunch will be in places nearby the venue to allow participants to network and discuss ideas in
smaller, informal groups.
Designing AI as a mediator for collaboration in health (60 minutes);Building on the challenges, opportunities,
and dimensions identified in earlier sessions, participants will work in groups to critically explore how AI could act as a
mediator in collaborative healthcare contexts. Rather than focusing on fully specified solutions, groups will examine
key moments of tension, negotiation, or breakdown in collaboration and articulate design opportunities, constraints,
and trade-offs. Through sketches, interaction narratives, or design prompts, participants will explore how AI-mediated
interventions might support shared decision-making while accounting for stakeholder perspectives, power dynamics,
agency, and ethical concerns.
Break(15 minutes):A coffee break for participants to refresh and network.
Creating and Sharing Group Stories (60 minutes):Groups will collaboratively develop speculative design stories
grounded in the scenarios and discussions from earlier sessions. Each story will articulate a collaborative healthcare
challenge, highlight tensions and stakeholder perspectives, and explore how AI could mediate collaboration, support
negotiation, or enhance shared decision-making. Groups will then present their stories to all participants, followed by
collective discussion and feedback to surface common themes, contrasting approaches, and key insights. The resulting
stories, along with the research questions and future research directions they generate, will contribute to shared
workshop outputs and inform the post-workshop white paper.
Reflection and wrap-up (30 minutes):The workshop will close with a collective reflection on key insights,
challenges, and research questions identified during the day. Organizers will summarize the outputs, discuss next steps,
and provide guidance on ongoing engagement, including follow-up activities or involvement in the next workshop
edition.

Dinner and informal discussions (optional):An informal dinner will provide additional opportunities for
networking, deeper discussions of ideas raised during the day, and fostering collaborations beyond the workshop.
Following the workshop, the organizers plan to consolidate the outputs from the discussions and collaborative
artifacts into a shared white paper outlining key insights, challenges, and future research directions. In addition,
participants will be invited to engage in follow-up activities, including the potential organization of a future edition of
the AI as Mediator for Collaborative Health workshop at a subsequent Interactive Health conference.
